  - Application type: Single-page application (SPA)
  - Name your application: Give your application a name (in my example, it was Owncast SPA app)
  - Options for sign-in identifiers: Email and Username
  - Required attributes for sign-up: Email (there won't be a sign-up option, but this field is required)
  - Leave the remaining fields default and create the user directory
  - Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Go to Overview button
    - #### Under User pool information, take note the User pool ID
